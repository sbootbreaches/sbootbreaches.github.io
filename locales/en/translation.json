    "research_details": "SecureBoot, designed to protect against firmware-level tampering, has long been dismissed as a \"local-only\" attack surface. This research shatters that assumption, exposing systemic flaws that enable remote exploitation of SecureBootâ€”culminating in Pre-Auth RCE on fully patched systems. With 31 CVEs discovered and fixed in Microsoft's SecureBoot implementation, we reveal how attackers can weaponize bootloader components (network stacks, BCD registries, filesystems) to bypass critical security guarantees."
